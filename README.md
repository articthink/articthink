- I’m primarily into in Network Science, but my background was originally the hinterland between AI and Psychology, and latterly Systems Engineering. I'm intersted in almost everything 'twixt synapse and star (including, for example, Agent Based Modelling.) 
- I’m currently learning Neo4J and how to parent a 1.5 year old. Neo4J is easier, but slightly less rewarding.)
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects relating to aspects of network science
- I'm based in Bristol, UK, but intergalactically-minded.
- Hit me up on articthink@gmail.com
