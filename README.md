- Hey there, thanks for taking an interest.
- I’m primarily into in Network Science, but my background was originally the hinterland between AI and Psychology, and latterly Systems Engineering. I'm intersted in almost everything 'twixt synapse and star (including, for example, Agent Based Modelling.) 
- I’m currently learning Neo4J and how to parent a 1.5 year old. Neo4J is easier, but slightly less rewarding.)
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects relating aspects of network science as manifest in nature, as well as anything ABM-related. E.g. Power laws, but I'm open to anything else that's cool
- I'm based in Bristol, UK, but intergalactically-minded.
- How to reach me: Hit me up on articthink@gmail.com
